1. Education, coding instructor. I am teaching my students to build Web services with node.js. They will each get hteir own developer account. This is my third year teaching this using Twitter's APIs as a platform.
2. No analysis will be done. API data will be requested on those the students follow. they learn to request data, then database it, and make an application using it.
3. They will learn to Tweet to their own accounts through the API, but that is minor.
4. Twitter data will be displayed in a GUI of their own individual designs. the project allows them to display those they are following, with some information, and the application allows them to keep notes about them.
